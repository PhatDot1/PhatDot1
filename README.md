# Hihi, I'm Patrick (我叫PP) 👋

## 📝 About Me

I build infrastructure and enjoy solving problems with creative solutions =)

## Technologies & Tools I Work With

### 💻 Languages
Python · TypeScript · Solidity · JavaScript · Rust  

### 🌐 Web Development
Next.js · React  

### ☁️ Cloud Services & Automation:
- APIs are the backbone of a good half of what I do here
- I use cloud services for marketing analytics pipelines, bots and scripts, operational infrastructure like building internal tools and extensions  
- Comfortably a DigitalOcean muncher, but I’ll make my way over to AWS or bare metal in due course :P

### 🔧 Infrastructure & Blockchain:
- RPC Nodes, Validators, & Faucets
- NFT Minters & Other Utility Smart Contracts (mainly EVM chains and occasionally Solana)

## Oops! Something went wrong

Sorry, not much open-source stuff happening here right now, but I'm often learning and building in private~
